- # Overview
- This is a bot for my discord channels to keep me and my friends math skiils sharp and honed.
- Using a mix of different math concepts (Calculus, Trigonometry, Arithmetic, Linear Algebra, Geometry) the discord user is prompted after a set amount of time to answer a randomly selected problem also randomly selected among the catagories.
- The user can either answer the question which then gives a response and congratulations, or times out the user for a set amount of time.
- This encourages study breaks and allows the user time to hone their skills without distraction
- Locally run on my personal machines, if you wish to run it on yours for your own groups, either use the link below or follow the installation instructions
